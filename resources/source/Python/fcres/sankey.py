# Modifications by Kevin Davies (kld@alumni.carnegiemellon.edu) 6/3/2011:
#   --Used arcs for the curves (so that the widths of the paths are uniform)
#   --Converted the function to a class and created methods to join multiple
#     simple Sankey diagrams
#   --Provided handling for cases where the total of the inputs isn't 100
#     Now, the default layout is based on the assumption that the inputs sum to
#     1.  A scaling parameter can be used in other cases.
#   --The call structure was changed to be more explicit about layout,
#     including the length of the trunk, length of the paths, gap between the
#     paths, and the margin around the diagram.
#   --Allowed the lengths of paths to be adjusted individually, with an option
#     to automatically justify them
#   --The call structure was changed to make the specification of path
#     orientation more flexible.  Flows are passed through one array, with
#     inputs being positive and outputs being negative.  An orientation
#     argument specifies the direction of the arrows.  The "main" inputs/
#     outputs are now specified via an orientation of 0, and there may be
#     several of each.
#   --Added assertions to catch common calling errors
#   --Added the physical unit as a string argument to be used in the labels, so
#     that the values of the flows can usually be applied automatically
#   --Added an argument for a minimum magnitude below which flows are not shown
#   --Added a tapered trunk in the case that the flows do not sum to 0
#   --Allowed the diagram to be rotated

        Optional keyword arguments:

          ===============   ===================================================
          Keyword           Description
          ===============   ===================================================
          *patchlabel*      label to be placed at the center of the diagram
                            Note: *label* (not *patchlabel*) will be passed to
                            create the patch through **kwargs and can be used
                            to an entry in the legend.
          *flows*           array of flow values
                            By convention, inputs are positive and outputs are
                            negative.
          *orientations*    list of orientations of the paths
                            Valid values are 1 (from/to the top), 0 (from/to
                            the left or right), or -1 (from/to the bottom).  If
                            *orientations* == 0, inputs will break in from the
                            left and outputs will break away to the right.
          *labels*          list of specifications of the labels for the flows
                            Each value may be *None* (no labels), '' (just
                            label the quantities), or a labeling string.  If a
                            single value is provided, it will be applied to all
                            flows.  If an entry is a non-empty string, then the
                            quantity for the corresponding flow will be shown
                            below the string.  However, if the *unit* of the
                            main diagram is *None*, then quantities are never
                            shown, regardless of the value of this argument.
          *trunklength*     length between the bases of the input and output
                            groups
          *pathlengths*     list of lengths of the arrows before break-in or
                            after break-away
                            If a single value is given, then it will be applied
                            to the first (inside) paths on the top and bottom,
                            and the length of all other arrows will be
                            justified accordingly.  The *pathlengths* are not
                            applied to the horizontal inputs and outputs.
          *prior*           index of the prior diagram to which this diagram
                            should be connected
          *connect*         a (prior, this) tuple indexing the flow of the
                            prior diagram and the flow of this diagram which
                            should be connected
                            If this is the first diagram or *prior* is *None*,
                            *connect* will be ignored.
          *rotation*        angle of rotation of the diagram [deg]
                            *rotation* is ignored if this diagram is connected
                            to an existing one (using *prior* and *connect*).
                            The interpretation of the *orientations* argument
                            will be rotated accordingly (e.g., if *rotation*
                            == 90, an *orientations* entry of 1 means to/from
                            the left).
          ===============   ===================================================

        Valid kwargs are :meth:`~matplotlib.patches.PathPatch` arguments:
        %(PathPatch)s
        As examples, *fill*=False and *label*="A legend entry".  By default,
        *facecolor*='#bfd1d4' (light blue) and *lineweight*=0.5.

        The indexing parameters (*prior* and *connect*) are zero-based.

        The flows are placed along the top of the diagram from the inside out
        order of their index within the *flows* list or array.  They are placed
        in along the sides of the diagram from the top down and along the
        bottom from the outside in.

        If the the sum of the inputs and outputs is nonzero, the discrepancy
        will appear as a cubic Bezier curve along the top and bottom edges of
        the trunk.
