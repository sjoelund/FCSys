units-values.mos is a copy of the flatted Modelica file (*.mof) generated by
translating FCSys.Units.Evaluate (each time the FCSys library is loaded via
FCSys/load.mos).  Since it is static, it may be run as a Modelica script.  The
values shown in the file are automatically encoded into the display unit
conversions.  The file is merely provided for diagnostics and interpreting
simulation results in other (non-Modelica) computer, analysis, or modeling
languages.
